For any given positive integer greater than 1, there are exactly 1 way to express the integer as a product of distinct prime numbers in increasing order, with positive integer exponents:
$$n = p_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdot p_{2} ^{e_{2}}\dots p_{k}^{e_{k}}$$
with  $p_{i+1} > p_{i} :\forall i\in [1,k]$

For the product of any 2 positive integer $m,n$ can be divided by a prime number $p$ (which means $p|m\times n$, then it is certain that either $p|m$ or $p|n$
