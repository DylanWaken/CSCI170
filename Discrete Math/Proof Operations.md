A **direct proof** is the use of [[Logical Arguments]], using premises, inference and equivalence rules. Direct proof can be also used among mathematic rules. 

To directly prove something we would write out our given facts as elementary mathematical formulas, and derive it until the formula shows the desired property of the objective.

A **Proof by Contraposition** works by proving a statement using an aternative equivalent statement but takes much less resources to proceed. Normally contrapoditive statements would be the "reverse" of the original statement but express the same meanings. 

**A Proof by Contradiction** is to start from assuming the assumption is false while derive an logical presentation that is impossible to hold (contradiction). When proof by contradiction, a general example need to be provided instead of a specific case.

**wlog:** Without loss of generality: used for repetitive proofs among identical elements.

## Negating Statements

De-Morgan's law can be frequently used:

$\exists n$ with property $X$ : negate : $\forall n$, $n$ have no $X$
$\forall n, n$ have property $X$ : negate : $\exists n, n$ do not have property $X$
$n$ either have property $X$ or $Y$ : negate : $n$ neither have property $X$ nor property $Y$

$\neg (X \Rightarrow Y) = X \land \neg Y$
