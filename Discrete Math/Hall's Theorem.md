The bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $<V_{1},V_{2}>$ is a complete mapping from $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$ is and only if: $$\lvert N(A) \rvert \geq \lvert  A \rvert, \forall A \subseteq V_{1}$$
Which means that the neighbor set of all possible subsets of $V_{1}$ must be greater than the subset itself, or there exists no node in $V_{2}$ became the only neighbor to multiple nodes in $V_{1}$  

There is a matching if all nodes in $V_{1}$ are matched with some distinctive node in $V_{2}$, which is the conclusion of Hall's theorem

The perfect matching means there exists a bijective matching relationship between nodes on both size.
