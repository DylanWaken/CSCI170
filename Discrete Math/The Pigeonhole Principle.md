- If there are more pegions than holes, there must be a hole with more than one pegion

This intuition stands for a mathematical definition, for a function between two collections that $f:X \rightarrow Y$and $|X| > |Y|$, then there must be elements $x_{1}, x_{2} \in X$ such that:
$$x_{1} \neq x_{2} \quad \text{and}\quad f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})$$
The pigenhole principle have an extension, if the relationship betweem the collections are $|X| > k  \cdot|Y|$ for arbitrary positive integer $k$, then there must exists elements $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{k+1} \in X$ such that:
$$f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) = \dots=f(x_{k+1})$$
